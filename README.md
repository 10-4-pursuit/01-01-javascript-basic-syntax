# JavaScript Basic Syntax

## Objective
Practice writing basic JavaScript syntax including variables, arithmetic operations, and console output.

## Instructions
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Create a file named `script.js`.

## Tasks
1. Write a JavaScript statement to create a constant named `greeting` with the value 'Hello, world!' and display it using `console.log()`.
2. Create two constants, `number` and `anotherNumber`, assign numerical values to them, and display their sum.
3. Write an 'if-else' statement to check if a variable `name` is equal to 'Alice'. If true, display 'Hello Alice!', otherwise display 'You are not Alice'.

## Submission
Commit and push your `script.js` file to this repository. The file should contain the JavaScript code for the above tasks.
